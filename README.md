The purpose of this project is to recreate the Google homepage. Functionality includes links to different Google services and policies.

## Learning Outcomes

---

### HTML

* Link to an external stylesheet within the **head** element to separate CSS from HTML (use the **link** element)
* The icon for a web page's title can be set within the **head** element as well
* Don't rely on **div** to make all containers/structures; use semantic elements like **header*, **nav**, and **footer**
* A **form** needs an *action* to know where to send data and a *method* to know how to send that data, via GET or POST
* Classes are useful for applying changes to groups of multiple elements
* A navigation menu can be made from a combination of **nav**, **ul**, and **li**
* Use an ID selector for a single element to apply a specific change(s)
* Every **input** (which is usually in a **form**) needs a *name* to function

### CSS

* Change the look of a border with the property **border-style**
* The property **border-radius** is useful for creating rounded corners on a border
* Horizontally aligning an element can be done using the **position** property and **margin** property, along with directional and spatial properties like **to**, **left**, **margin-right**, etc., and **transform** with the *translate* value; vertical alignment can be done in the same style
* Remember to use **width** and **height** properties to make elements smaller or larger
* Pseudo classes, which specify element relations, aren't just for links; they can be used with images, buttons, and other elements
* Set the **display** property of list items (**li**) with the *inline* value to place items in a single line
* Use different types of selectors to change the scale of effects, such as descendant selectors or descendant selectors with pseudo classes
